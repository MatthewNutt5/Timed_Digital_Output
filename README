Timed_Digital_Output - Class for toggling an Arduino digital output pin at a
set frequency/period and duty cycle, using the micros() function for timing.
Requires constant polling by loop() to operate. Quite naive.

Currently, you must copy the .cpp and .h file into the same directory as the
Arduino .ino file for the sketch to properly compile. This wouldn't be
necessary if I added this to the Arduino Library Manager, but that's extra work
and I'm not *that* invested.

See the TDO_example folder for a demonstration of the class; everything is
pretty simple and self-explanatory.
